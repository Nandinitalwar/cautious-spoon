Final Projects: Please submit a brief descriptive synopsis alongside your final project. Each final project must have a description synopsis. The 500-1000 word synopsis should detail your project's structure, content, and contribution. Do not duplicate the synopsis for group projects. Each student will write an individual synopsis.

CU Sustainable: doomed… till we’re not!

For the final project, I created a program called “doomed” in the programming language C, that takes in as input the name of a common food item and returns three metrics to the user. The first is greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram, the second is the total impact they have had so far, and lastly is the average impact they’ve had which is computed over the course of their day.

The goal of this was to make Columbia students more aware of the environmental impact of their food choices, and to inspire them to make better choices. Too often, due to the easy availability of food at the dining hall, students get more food than they need and waste the rest. In certain dining halls like Ferris and JJ’s, the dining hall lacks reusable cutlery, so food wastage multiplies other kinds of wastage of plastic forks, paper plates, et al. 

Before I started this project, I wasn’t conscious of the environmental impact of food items I ate every day. I associated greenhouse gas emissions on an individual level with activities like driving and using electricity, not with eating. However, being made aware of the environmental impact of foods I consume daily like milk, coffee, and bananas, and therefore how my own eating patterns affect demand for certain food items, I started changing my choices to be more conscious. 

I initially began this project by searching the internet for data on the greenhouse gas emissions of commonly consumed foods. This was a challenging task as I wasn’t sure how to measure environmental impact and what constituted it. I came across a metric called the ecological footprint analysis (EFA), which takes into account the amount of land needed to provide the resources to produce a product or measure a level of consumption (Wackernagel and Rees, 1996). 

While I initially began only with greenhouse gas emissions, the EFA allowed me to assign a numerical value to food consumption based directly on the amount of land needed to provide resources to its production. Not only did this provide me with a deeper understanding, but it also provided the user with a nuanced explanation of at a lower-level, how certain food consumption is different from others.

Stretch goals:
1.	To provide alternative foods similar to the food inputted that have less greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram. 
2.	To provide students with a historical understanding of where ubiquitous products we use come from, and who they are harming.
